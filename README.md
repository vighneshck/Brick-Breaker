# Brick-Breaker

A modified 2D version of the classic Brick Breaker game, implemented using OpenGL3. Using concepts of physics like gravity and optics, it allows users to collect randomly falling bricks, while also enabling them to shoot laser rays at the bricks.

# How to Run:
The Brick Breaker Game can be run by typing the following commands in the terminal:  
$ cd Brick-Breaker    
$ ./sample2D  
Note: According to the instructions in the problem statement pdf, the executable has already been attached in the folder. Hence, there is no need to further compile the source code using the make command.
We can clear the executable in the folder by typing the following command in the terminal:  
$ make clean
